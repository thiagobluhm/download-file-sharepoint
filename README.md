# download-file-sharepoint
This repository contains my own first sharepoint download codification. Iniatily it's very simple code, I used some libs how office365 for python.
The source will create the folder to receive files that comes from sharepoint.

It's important understand in the first hand that You'll need take a application password into sharepoint. 
You can not use your sharepoint password, if you do this the algorithm does not work!
